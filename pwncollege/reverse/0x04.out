bytearray(b'\x01\xff\x04')
[+] Welcome to /challenge/babyrev_level22.1!
[+] This challenge is an custom emulator. It emulates a completely custom
[+] architecture that we call "Yan85"! You'll have to understand the
[+] emulator to understand the architecture, and you'll have to understand
[+] the architecture to understand the code being emulated, and you will
[+] have to understand that code to get the flag. Good luck!
[+]
[+] This level is a full Yan85 emulator. You'll have to reason about yancode,
[+] and the implications of how the emulator interprets it!
[?] This challenge is special! It randomizes the Yan85 VM based on
[?] the value of the flag. This means that there is no way for you
[?] to know the opcode and argument encodings...
[?]
[?] Keep in mind that the encoding that you observe in practice mode
[?] is going to be different than the actual encoding, because the
[?] practice mode flag is different. How will you adapt?
[?]
[?] Is there maybe a clever side channel you can utilize?
[?] ... Done! VM is randomized!
[!] This time, YOU'RE in control! Please input your yancode: [+] Starting interpreter loop! Good luck!
